## Getting Started

## **💡 Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21**: Install the latest JDK for optimal performance.
- **Maven**: Make sure Maven is installed to handle the project build.
- **MySQL Database**: You'll need to have MySQL installed and set up to manage your data.
- **Apache Tomcat**: A servlet container for running your web application.
- **IDE**: Use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java IDE you're comfortable with.
- **Git (optional)**: For version control and easier collaboration.

## **💡Steps to Get Started**

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:shreyamahalle/servlet-booking-management-project.git

## 2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

- cd maven-booking-management-project

## 3. **Open the Project in Your Preferred IDE:**

- Launch your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.), and open the cloned repository.

## 4. **Set up the MySQL Database:**

- CREATE DATABASE booking_management;
  USE booking_management;

## 5. **MySQL Database Setup**

- To set up the database and create the necessary tables, run the following SQL queries:
  -- Insert sample data into the Customer table
  INSERT INTO Customer (name, username, mobileNo, city, area)
  VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe123', '123-456-7890', 'New York', 'Manhattan');

## 6. **Configure Your MySQL Connection:**

- In your project configuration (application.properties), set the MySQL database connection details.

- Example application.properties:

- spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/booking_management
- spring.datasource.username=root
- spring.datasource.password=your_password
- spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

## 7. **Compile and Run the Application:**

- Locate Main.java in your IDE.

- Run the file to launch the application.

## 8. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## 9. **Deploy to Tomcat:**

Copy the generated WAR file from the `target` directory to the `webapps` directory of your Tomcat server.

## 10. **Start Tomcat:**

Start the Tomcat server and access the application at `http://localhost:8080/customer-controller`.

## Usage

- **User Registration:** Navigate to the registration page and create a new account.
- **User Login:** Log in with your credentials to access the application.
- **CRUD Operations:** Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on the data.
- **Session Management:** Manage user sessions effectively.
